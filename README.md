`Swir/swir.github.io` hosts the public SWIR OS preview and synchronized development status. It is **not** a source repository for the operating system and does not own roadmap truth.

## Canonical project

All SWIR OS implementation is developed in **[Swir/SWIR_OS](https://github.com/Swir/SWIR_OS)**: Web Edition, Desktop Edition, System Edition, native applications, services, package/runtime infrastructure, Live USB/installer work, hardware and driver work, CI, roadmap, builds and releases.

The authoritative roadmap is [SWIR_OS/SWIR-OS-ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/Swir/SWIR_OS/blob/main/SWIR-OS-ARCHITECTURE.md). This site mirrors verified values only after they are merged there.

## Current verified status

| Edition | Status |
|---|---|
| Web Edition | `1.7.13` |
| Desktop Edition | `0.5.7-preview` |
| System Edition | In development |
| Overall roadmap | **53 / 65 — 81.5%** |
| Release readiness | **Not ready** |

The current canonical System Edition milestone set now includes two additional verified native daily-use applications: **SWIR Browser** and **SWIR Player**. SWIR Browser runs on GTK4/WebKitGTK 6.0 with tabs, bounded owner-only history/bookmarks, downloads, ephemeral private tabs, explicit permission prompts, Default Apps integration and approved alternative-browser handoff through Software Center. SWIR Player runs on GTK4/GStreamer for local audio/video with bounded owner-only library/playlists, MPRIS2 media-key integration, Gio notifications and desktop MIME integration. Both remain unprivileged and do not bypass the package/update security boundary. The complete native daily-use application suite is still an open release gate.

The existing boot/install path remains verified in disposable UEFI VMs: the final image boots as QEMU USB mass storage, the native GTK4 installer requires exact target review and destructive confirmation, installs to a separate blank disk, and the installed system boots graphically with persistence after the source USB is removed. This is meaningful VM evidence, **not** a claim of broad physical-PC support. Physical Live USB boot/install qualification is still open, and Secure Boot plus legacy BIOS remain unclaimed until separately tested.

The canonical repo uses deterministic **SWIR Progress SVG PRO** assets generated from the authoritative roadmap. The card shown here is a presentation snapshot using the same visual language; its source of truth remains `Swir/SWIR_OS`. The canonical roadmap/README presentation is SVG-only for progress meters; text values remain as accessible data, not duplicate character-based bars.

Public progress here is updated only after the corresponding implementation is merged and verified in `Swir/SWIR_OS`. Current canonical snapshot commit: [`195de51`](https://github.com/Swir/SWIR_OS/commit/195de5199b9ba33e6a03b4367bc03701bcb5db1e).

## Repository role

This repository may contain website assets and older independent web/retro experiments. New SWIR OS product code, architecture contracts, System/Desktop/Web implementation, build tooling and authoritative progress calculations must be committed to `Swir/SWIR_OS`, not here.
